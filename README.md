# Jenkins Pipeline: Update and Deploy Hello World Script

This repository contains a Jenkins pipeline script that performs the following steps:

## Stages

### Checkout
In this stage, the pipeline checks out the code from the repository. This is the first step to ensure the latest code is being worked on.

### Build
In the build stage, a Python script named `helloworld.py` is created. This script contains a simple "Hello World" Python code snippet.

### Test
In the test stage, the content of the `helloworld.py` script is displayed using the `type` command. This step is used to verify that the script has been created correctly.

### Deploy
In the deploy stage, the pipeline deploys the changes back to the GitHub repository. The following actions are performed:

1. The credentials configured in Jenkins are used to authenticate.
2. The `helloworld.py` script is added to the Git index using `git add`.
3. A commit is made with the message "Update helloworld.py" using `git commit`.
4. The changes are pushed to the remote repository on the `main` branch using `git push`.

## Usage
This Jenkins pipeline script automates the process of creating a basic "Hello World" script, verifying its content, and then deploying the changes back to the GitHub repository.

To use this pipeline in your own Jenkins environment, you can:

1. Create a new Jenkins job.
2. Paste the provided pipeline script into the job configuration.
3. Configure your Jenkins job to use the appropriate credentials for Git authentication.
4. Run the job to see the pipeline stages in action.
